When we say &#8220;Bank&#8221; we are talking about the entire federal financial institution, not just your local retail bank or credit union that you can walk into. The entire federal banking system governs interest rates and determines how cash flows to and from your local retail bank that can also affect how you use your cash in your personal checking or savings accounts.&nbsp; This needs to be considered for several reasons, one being it will determine your Predictable Distribution Rate.
